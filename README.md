# 👨🏽‍🏫 Python Basics for Data Science

This notebook introduces essential Python concepts for Data Science, covering control flow structures, data manipulation using lists and dictionaries, and providing practical examples that prepare learners for more complex data analysis tasks.

## 📜 Overview

### 1. Conditional Structures
Conditional structures (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are fundamental tools for decision-making in Python. In the context of Data Science, they are used to apply different treatments to data based on its characteristics. Examples in this notebook include classifying grades based on specified ranges.

### 2. Loops
Loops (`while` and `for`) are useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as processing data and iterating over large data sets:
- **`while`**: Ideal for scenarios where the exact number of iterations is unknown and we want to repeat until a condition is met.
- **`for`**: Used to iterate over lists, dictionaries, or ranges of values, allowing systematic analysis of elements, such as data stored in collections.

### 3. Data Structures for Manipulation
Data Science involves intensive data manipulation. This notebook introduces basic structures for these tasks:
- **Lists**: Store ordered sets of data and allow easy manipulation, such as adding and removing elements. Examples include storing lists of numbers and calculating averages.
- **Dictionaries**: Store data in key-value pairs, useful for representing relational data. In this notebook, dictionaries are used to represent student information, allowing easy access and modification of specific attributes.

### 4. Data Manipulation Methods
With lists and dictionaries, the notebook explores various manipulation methods such as:
- **Lists**: `append()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, and slicing with indices. These methods are useful for organizing and filtering data.
- **Dictionaries**: `pop()`, `items()`, `keys()`, and `values()` for accessing and updating information, a fundamental concept when working with data that has multiple characteristics.

## Applications in Data Science

These basic concepts form the foundation of many operations in Data Science, such as:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Conditional structures and loops are used for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Data Exploration**: `for` loops and lists help iterate over columns and records for descriptive analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: List and dictionary methods enable organizing and transforming data sets, essential for subsequent analysis.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the use of conditionals to apply business logic in data analysis.
- Use loops to iterate over large data sets.
- Manipulate lists and dictionaries to organize, access, and modify data.
- Familiarize with basic Python methods to organize and transform data into a format suitable for analysis.

## Requirements

- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab**: It is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to view and run the code. Google Colab is a free, online notebook environment that requires no local setup.

## Running on Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. In the upper right corner, click **File** > **Upload notebook**.
3. Select the `.ipynb` file to upload and open it in Google Colab.
4. Follow the sequence of cells, running each code block to understand the concepts.
5. Experiment with modifying the examples to see how changes affect the output, reinforcing your understanding of Python data manipulation fundamentals.
